### Overview
This data tells the story of the daily sales transactions from a fictional coffee shop from March 2024 to March 2025. It gives us an insight into the most preferred coffee type by customers, the time of day customers buy coffee the most, and their most preferred payment method. By looking into this data, we can discover insights into customer behaviour and business performance. These findings can help the coffee shop improve its efficiency, particularly in terms of operations, and explore more effective ways to serve its customers.

- Identify the most bought coffee types by customers.
